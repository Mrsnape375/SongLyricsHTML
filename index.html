    <pre>
<b>
The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the <i>bar</i> is where I go
<u>Me</u> and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
Come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
<mark>Take my hand</mark>, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like
<del>Girl</del>, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
...
I'm in love with the shape of you
</b>

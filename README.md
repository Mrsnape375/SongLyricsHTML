# 🎵 Shape of You — But Make It HTML

Welcome to one of my very first HTML projects!

This isn’t a shrine to Ed Sheeran (I swear 😅), but there’s something about this song — maybe it’s the beat, maybe it’s the fact that it plays in every mall on Earth — that made me pick it for my first experiment with multimedia and tags.

I wanted to see if I could bring:
- 🎤 lyrics to life (with `<b>`, `<i>`, `<u>`, and `<mark>`)
- 🎥 a video player
- 🖼️ album art wrapped in a clickable link
- and a button that might just take you further down the Ed rabbit hole (you're welcome)

No fanboying here... just a budding coder using catchy music as motivation to learn HTML. 😎  
Feel free to vibe along or fork it and make your own lyrical masterpiece!
